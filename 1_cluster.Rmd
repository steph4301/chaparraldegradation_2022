# The differences from 2 to 3 groups (-8) and from 3 to 4 groups (-4) are small, 
# indicating that moving from 2 to 4 clusters doesn’t significantly improve the ISA scores. 
# This suggests that the structure in the data is relatively stable with these numbers of clusters, 
# and adding more groups is not greatly improving how well species are associated with their clusters.

# The difference from 4 to 5 groups is -90, which is a noticeable drop. This indicates that introducing a 5th cluster starts to capture more distinct ecological patterns, improving the ISA scores.

# Optimal Number of Clusters:
# 4 clusters may be suboptimal due to the small improvement seen moving to 4 clusters from 3 (-4).
# 5 clusters is likely the best choice. The drop to -90 suggests that the 5-cluster solution 
# is where distinct ecological patterns are maximized before significant over-segmentation occurs.
# Adding more than 5 clusters likely results in diminishing returns, as indicated by the sharp declines in ISA scores.
