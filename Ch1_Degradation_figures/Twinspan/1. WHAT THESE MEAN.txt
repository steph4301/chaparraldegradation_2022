Okay im gonna send this exact text as an email, but here it is again for reference.

For the text files, make sure the font is "Consolas" otherwise the spacing will get weird 
(i can send screenshots if needed, but it wont be as high quality)

The text files contain two outputs: 
	1. summary(tw_data): this is the summary of the twinspan eigenvalues and indicator species analysis.
		- It is split up into groups, based on binary number (so may not be intuitive)
		- Each will either have an eigen value (eig) or an N
		- The N indicates that those sites are the most closely related to each other, and cannot be divided furtherm based on the rules we set for the twinspan
		- The eigen value is unimportant right now, what is important is the names of the species next to it
		- The species listed are the indicator species! and they tell us how the sites were divided
		- The species will either have a plus (+) or a minus (-), the plus means that species is indicitive of the groups on the right side, and vice versa
		- an example, from the "data outputs file", "1) eig=0.404:  +Heteromeles.arbutifolia1 < 1" 
			- Group 1 is the entire data set, the groups under group 1 in this case are groups 2 and 3. The +Heteromeles.arbutifolia means that the presence of HEAR inidicates a site is in group 3, as opposed to group 2. 
		- Theres always at least one species, sometimes more. 
	2. twintable(tw_data)
		- I showed this to you almost a month ago, this is just a redrawing of the species table, but in the form of psuedospecies
		- If two species show up near each other, it means theyre likely to be found together, and if theyre far apart, then theyre not.
		- This is the same with sites, close means similar species makeup, far means different species makeup
		- The 1's and 0's are the binary numbers of each group, and why the summary table has values like 89

The images are dendrograms of the groups created by the twinspan, and they basically tell the same story as the twintable and summary combined. 
It is just a visual representation of which species are found in the same/different sites, and which sites have similar/different species. 
In both the INT sites are always the first group out with HEAR being the indicator. 

I can also look into labeling the dendrograms in depth. 
I leave the data for you to ponder, I apologize for the delay I had to mess around in R to get good figures.
