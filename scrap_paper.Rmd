(1) How does community composition (e.g., percent cover by lifeform, shrub recruitment) and structure (e.g., canopy height) change across a shrub-grass recovery gradient?, (2) How many community-types can be identified across a shrub-grass ‘recovery’ gradient and which species define each community-type?Can transitional plant groupings be identified between shrub-dominated and grass-dominated communities and, if so, which species define these groupings?, (3) How do environmental variables (i.e., slope, aspect, southwestness, total solar radiation, recent fire history) differ among community-types?, and (4) How do seedbank communities along a shrub-grass recovery gradient compare in terms of native species richness and composition?
