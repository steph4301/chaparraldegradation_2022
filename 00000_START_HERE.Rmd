COV - there's code to calculate COV in ab_heightdensity.Rmd, but I would need to edit the code to include all 40 transects. 

_Files no longer in use:_
1.2_twinspan.Rmd <-- I'm not running TWINSPAN analysis. Plus, I can't run the program on a Mac.
2.1_transect_compile_environdata.Rmd <- these are the flowcharts
2.3_PCA.Rmd <-- Don't run this code for PCAs. Run NMDSs instead. - SML (june 7, 2025)

ab_percentcover.Rmd <- i think this is an old .Rmd. I'm still using STANDTYPE, and the transect list isn't complete - specifically, df: abcover_vegcover_long_vegonly includes 14 transects at Site 1, five transects at INT, BUT only 1 transects at SIte 2. <-- I would need to add CLUSTER names (df: my_groups) to run by cluster name instead of by STANDTYPE or to add standtype data in a new column.

ab_heightdensity.Rmd <- I think this is an old file too. The standstypes are DEG1, DEG2, ENH1, ENH2, INT1, INT2, INT3, which reflect the old data before I collected more tansect data (transects should be n = 40).


_Useful code to hang on to:_
#### save figure
# ggsave("Ch1_Degradation_figures/nmds_above_vectors.png", nmdsabove_plot_site_rep, width = 8, height = 6)


(7) NMDS by site (e.g., Intact_1) <-- from 1.3_NMDS_percentcover.Rmd ~line 1102 (code from KIT)
```{r transpose site percent cover data, eval = FALSE}

# pivot wider to create a matrix of percent cover by species by transect (n = 40)
abcover_bysite_nmdsprep <- abcover_byspecies %>% 
  tidyr::spread(site_rep, percentcover) %>% # transpose data so columns are site_rep
  replace(is.na(.), 0) # replace NA with zeros
view(abcover_bysite_nmdsprep)

abcover_bysite_nmdsprep_num <- abcover_bysite_nmdsprep %>% 
  # use the ungroup() function to take out grouping
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(!c(standtype, site, species, status, lifeform, lifecycle, count_per_dist))
         
view(abcover_bysite_nmdsprep_num) # only numbers
```

abcover_fulljoin %>% group_by(site) %>% length(unique(transect))

(1) How does community composition (e.g., percent cover by lifeform, shrub recruitment) and structure (e.g., canopy height) change across a shrub-grass recovery gradient?, (2) How many community-types can be identified across a shrub-grass ‘recovery’ gradient and which species define each community-type?Can transitional plant groupings be identified between shrub-dominated and grass-dominated communities and, if so, which species define these groupings?, (3) How do environmental variables (i.e., slope, aspect, southwestness, total solar radiation, recent fire history) differ among community-types?, and (4) How do seedbank communities along a shrub-grass recovery gradient compare in terms of native species richness and composition?
